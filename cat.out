     ccaatt -- concatenate and print files

     ccaatt [--bbeennssttuuvv] [_f_i_l_e _._._.]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ccaatt utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard
     output.  The _f_i_l_e operands are processed in command-line order.  If _f_i_l_e
     is a single dash (`-') or absent, ccaatt reads from the standard input.  If
     _f_i_l_e is a UNIX domain socket, ccaatt connects to it and then reads it until
     EOF.  This complements the UNIX domain binding capability available in
     inetd(8).

     The options are as follows:

     --bb      Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.

     --ee      Display non-printing characters (see the --vv option), and display
             a dollar sign (`$') at the end of each line.

     --nn      Number the output lines, starting at 1.

     --ss      Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be
             single spaced.

     --tt      Display non-printing characters (see the --vv option), and display
             tab characters as `^I'.

     --uu      Disable output buffering.

     --vv      Display non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control
             characters print as `^X' for control-X; the delete character
             (octal 0177) prints as `^?'.  Non-ASCII characters (with the high
             bit set) are printed as `M-' (for meta) followed by the character
             for the low 7 bits.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ccaatt utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     The command:

           cat file1

     will print the contents of _f_i_l_e_1 to the standard output.

     The command:

           cat file1 file2 > file3

     will sequentially print the contents of _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 to the file
     _f_i_l_e_3, truncating _f_i_l_e_3 if it already exists.  See the manual page for
     your shell (i.e., sh(1)) for more information on redirection.

     The command:

           cat file1 - file2 - file3

     will print the contents of _f_i_l_e_1, print data it receives from the stan-
     dard input until it receives an EOF (`^D') character, print the contents
     of _f_i_l_e_2, read and output contents of the standard input again, then
     finally output the contents of _f_i_l_e_3.  Note that if the standard input
     referred to a file, the second dash on the command-line would have no
     effect, since the entire contents of the file would have already been
     read and printed by ccaatt when it encountered the first `-' operand.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ccaatt utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (``POSIX.2'')
     specification.

     The flags [--bbeennssttvv] are extensions to the specification.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A ccaatt utility appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.  Dennis Ritchie designed
     and wrote the first man page.  It appears to have been cat(1).

BBUUGGSS
     Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output redirect-
     ion, the command ``cat file1 file2 > file1'' will cause the original data
     in file1 to be destroyed!

     The ccaatt utility does not recognize multibyte characters when the --tt or --vv
     option is in effect.
